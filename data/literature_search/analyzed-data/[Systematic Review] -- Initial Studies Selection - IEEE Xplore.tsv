Elizaveta Zimina; Jyrki Nummenmaa; Kalervo Jarvelin; Jaakko Peltonen; Kostas Stefanidis	MuG-QA: Multilingual Grammatical Question Answering for RDF Data	We introduce [::Multilingual::] Grammatical [::Question Answering::] (MuG-[::QA::]), a system for answering questions in the English, German, Italian and French languages over [::DBpedia::]. The natural language modelling and parsing is implemented using Grammatical Framework (GF), a grammar formalism having natural support for [::multilinguality::]. The question analysis is based on forming an ab...	2018	https://doi.org/10.1109/PIC.2018.8706310	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8706310	1	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8706310/	TRUE
Xiangzhou Huang; Baogang Wei; Yin Zhang	Automatic Question-Answering Based on Wikipedia Data Extraction	The [::question-answering::] ([::QA::]) system plays a vital role in artificial intelligence. The goal of automatic [::QA::] is to find out correct answers to the natural language questions raised by users from some specified datasets. Data on the Web is about everything and contains almost all the answers we needed.

Aleksandr Perevalov; Dennis Diefenbach; Ricardo Usbeck; Andreas Both	QALD-9-plus: A Multilingual Dataset for Question Answering over DBpedia and Wikidata Translated by Native Speakers	The ability to have the same experience for different user groups (i.e., accessibility) is one of the most important characteristics of Web-based systems. The same is true for [::Knowledge Graph::] [::Question Answering::] ([::KGQA::]) systems that provide the access to [::Semantic ::][::Web::][:: data::] via [::natural language interface::].

Bo Liu; Li-Ming Zhan; Li Xu; Lin Ma; Yan Yang; Xiao-Ming Wu	Slake: A Semantically-Labeled Knowledge-Enhanced Dataset For Medical Visual Question Answering	Medical visual [::question answering::] (Med-VQA) has tremendous potential in healthcare. However, the development of this technology is hindered by the lacking of publicly-available and high-quality labeled datasets for training and evaluation. In this paper, we present a large [::bilingual::] dataset, SLAKE, with comprehensive semantic labels annotated by experienced physicians and a new structu...	2021	https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9434010	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9434010	1	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9434010/	FALSE
Santosh K. Ray; Khaled Shaalan	A Review and Future Perspectives of Arabic Question Answering Systems	[::Question Answering::] Systems (QASs) have emerged as a good alternative for information seekers to retrieve precise information over the Internet. A good amount of research has been done to improve the performance of QASs across [::several languages::], including European and Asian languages. However, Arabic, a morphologically rich Semitic language spoken by over 422 million people, has not see...	2016	https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2016.2607201	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7563293	25	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7563293/	FALSE

Zhichao Duan; Xiuxing Li; Zhengyan Zhang; Zhenyu Li; Ning Liu; Jianyong Wang	Bridging the Language Gap: Knowledge Injected Multilingual Question Answering	[::Question Answering::] ([::QA::]) is the task of automati-cally answering questions posed by humans in natural languages. There are different settings to answer a question, such as abstractive, extractive, boolean, and multiple-choice [::QA::]. As a popular topic in natural language processing tasks, extractive [::question answering::] task (extractive [::QA::]) has gained extensive attention in...	2021	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICKG52313.2021.00052	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9667687	0	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9667687/	FALSE
Aleksandr Perevalov; Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo; Andreas Both	Enhancing the Accessibility of Knowledge Graph Question Answering Systems through Multilingualization	There are around 7000 languages spoken today in the world, yet English dominates in many research communities e.g., [::Knowledge Graph::] [::Question Answering::] ([::KGQA::]).

This is visible in the fact that they are vulnerable to learning coincidental correlations in the data rather than deeper relations between image content and ideas expressed in language. We present a dataset that takes a step towards addressing this problem in that it contains ques...	2020	https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.01014	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9156857	11	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9156857/	FALSE
E. Whittaker; S. Furui; D. Klakow	A statistical classification approach to question answering using Web data	In this paper we treat [::question answering::] ([::QA::]) as a classification problem. Our motivation is to build systems for [::many languages::] without the need for highly tuned linguistic modules. Consequently, word tokens and [::Web data::] are used extensively but no explicit linguistic knowledge is incorporated.

Mattia Atzeni; Maurizio Atzori	AskCO: A Multi-language and Extensible Smart Virtual Assistant	This paper discusses a language-independent approach for building smart and easily-extensible personal assistants and chatbots. Given a natural language utterance, the system extracts a formal meaning representation that enables mapping the user intent to the execution of a Java source code. This allows building both smart personal assistants and chatbots that can be easily extended by overriding ...	2019	https://doi.org/10.1109/AIKE.2019.00028	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8791728	0	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8791728/	FALSE

Shivangi Nanda; Parteek Bhatia	Semantic search engine and its strategies with IAN encoder	A semantic based approach is better in many ways than the keyword based searches.
