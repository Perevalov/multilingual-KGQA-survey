abstract = {The amount of structured content published on the Web has been growing rapidly, making it possible to address increasingly complex information access tasks. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of large scale human-curated knowledge bases as well as a growing array of techniques that identify or extract information automatically from unstructured and semi-structured sources. The ESAIR workshop series aims to advance the general research agenda on the problem of creating and exploiting semantic annotations. The eighth edition of ESAIR took place at CIKM 2015 in Melbourne, Australia, on the 23rd of October. Having a special focus on applications, we dedicated an "annotations in action" track to demonstrations that showcase innovative prototype systems, in addition to the regular research and position paper contributions. The workshop also featured invited talks from leaders in the field. This report presents an overview of the event and its major outcomes.},

abstract="While RDF was designed to make data easily readable by machines, it does not make data easily usable by end-users. Question Answering (QA) over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is seen as the technology which is able to bridge this gap. It aims to build systems which are capable of extracting the answer to a user's natural language question from an RDF dataset.",

    abstract = "{Semantic parsing (SP) allows humans to leverage vast knowledge resources through natural interaction. However, parsers are mostly designed for and evaluated on English resources, such as CFQ (Keysers et al., 2020), the current standard benchmark based on English data generated from grammar rules and oriented towards Freebase, an outdated knowledge base. We propose a method for creating a multilingual, parallel dataset of question-query pairs, grounded in Wikidata. We introduce such a dataset, which we call Multilingual Compositional Wikidata Questions (MCWQ), and use it to analyze the compositional generalization of semantic parsers in Hebrew, Kannada, Chinese, and English. While within- language generalization is comparable across languages, experiments on zero-shot cross- lingual transfer demonstrate that cross-lingual compositional generalization fails, even with state-of-the-art pretrained multilingual encoders. Furthermore, our methodology, dataset, and results will facilitate future research on SP in more realistic and diverse settings than has been possible with existing resources.}",

abstract = {This research paper proposes an approach called Lingua Franca that improves machine translation quality by utilizing information from a knowledge graph to translate named entities accurately. The accurate entity translation is crucial when applied to entity-oriented search including Knowledge Graph Question Answering systems. In a nutshell, the approach preserves recognized named entities with an entity-replacement technique during the translation process. It replaces the entities back with their labels found in a knowledge graph for the target language to ensure that questions are translated correctly before answering them using a Knowledge Graph Question Answering system. The paper also introduces an open-source modular framework that enables researchers to design their own named entity-aware machine translation pipelines. The presented experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Lingua Franca approach in comparison to baseline Machine Translation models. The approach shows a statistically significant improvement in the quality provided by several Knowledge Graph Question Answering systems using Lingua Franca on different datasets.},
